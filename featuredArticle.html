            <p class="hero-body hero-body-featured">After several months of learning how to code while studying computer science, 
                I've made the big jump over to learn web development as I found that I have a passion
                for creating beautiful and interactive sites.</p>

                <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
                <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to 
                    spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple 
                    projects using what I learned or work new techniques into 
                    existing projects.</p>
                <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share 
                    what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world</p>

            <div class="featured-article-main-paragraph">
                <h3>How I got started</h3>
                <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would 
                    take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use 
                    my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries 
                    of what I learned using my own words.</p>
                <p>That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries 
                    was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
